# GradleBuildPlugins

ðŸ‘€ Sample project that shows you how to configure plugins. After generating the project from this template, remember that you need to customize detekt rules and spotless plugin, if needed:

- If you need to customize detekt rules, edit the detekt.yml on your root directory

- Inside the spotless folder, on your root directory - add your license file

- Remember to refactor the package name :rocket:

### Prerequisites

Before every commit, make sure you run the following commands:

```shell script
./gradlew dependencyUpdate
```

Refer to this [issue](https://github.com/gradle/gradle/issues/10248), if you get any issues running the lint commands on the terminal :rocket:
